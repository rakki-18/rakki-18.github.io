I am Rakshit P, a second year undergraduate CSE student at National Institute of Technology Karnataka. I am passionate about Medical Imaging, Natural Language Processing, Algorithms, Machine Learning and I am always looking to explore something new. <br><br>
I am a member of [IEEE NITK](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/) and [Web Enthusiasts' Club NITK](https://webclub.nitk.ac.in/new/#/) where I am undertaking projects and using my technical knowledge to actually make a change. <br>
